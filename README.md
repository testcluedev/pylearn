**Starter Exercises 

    Hello, World!: Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

    Simple Calculator: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

    Odd or Even: Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints whether the number is odd or even.

    Factorial: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

    Fibonacci Series: Write a program that prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci series.

    Palindrome: Write a program that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.

    Prime Numbers: Write a program that prints all prime numbers in a given range.

    List Comprehension: Use list comprehension to create a new list from a given list. For example, create a new list of squares of numbers from a list of numbers.

    Temperature Conversion: Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

    Guessing Game: Write a program for a simple guessing game. The program should randomly choose a number between 1 and 100, and then ask the user to guess the number. The program should tell the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Exercise with Function

    Multiplication Table: Write a function that takes an integer n and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 10.

    Greatest Common Divisor: Write a function that takes two integers and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

    Least Common Multiple: Write a function that takes two integers and returns their least common multiple (LCM).

    Prime Checker: Write a function that takes an integer and returns True if the number is prime, otherwise False.

    Factorial: Write a function that takes an integer n and returns its factorial.

    Fibonacci Sequence: Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Palindrome Checker: Write a function that takes a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome, otherwise False.

    List Sorting: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the list sorted in ascending order.

    Word Count: Write a function that takes a string and returns the count of words in the string.

    Temperature Converter: Write two functions, one that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and another that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Exercises with Loops

    Sum of Numbers: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n.

    Factorial: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the factorial of n.

    Multiplication Table: Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.

    Prime Numbers: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints all prime numbers up to n.

    Fibonacci Sequence: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Reverse a String: Write a program that asks the user for a string and prints the string in reverse order.

    Counting Odd and Even Numbers: Write a program that asks the user for a list of numbers and then prints the count of odd and even numbers in the list.

    List of Squares: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints a list of the squares of the numbers from 1 to n.

    Pattern Printing: Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints a pattern of stars (*) of n lines.

    Multiples of a Number: Write a program that asks the user for two numbers n and m, and prints all multiples of n up to m.

Exercises with Error catching

    Divide by Zero: Write a function that divides two numbers and catches the ZeroDivisionError exception.

    Invalid Input: Write a function that takes an integer input from the user and catches the ValueError exception if the input is not an integer.

    File Not Found: Write a function that reads a file and catches the FileNotFoundError exception if the file does not exist.

    List Index: Write a function that takes a list and an index, and returns the element at that index. Catch the IndexError exception if the index is out of bounds.

    Dictionary Key: Write a function that takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value of that key. Catch the KeyError exception if the key does not exist.

    Convert to Integer: Write a function that converts a list of strings to a list of integers. Catch the ValueError exception if any of the strings cannot be converted to an integer.

    Open File: Write a function that opens a file and writes some text to it. Catch the IOError exception if the file cannot be opened or written to.

    Square Root: Write a function that takes a number and returns its square root. Catch the ValueError exception if the number is negative.

    List of Integers: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the integers. Catch the TypeError exception if the list contains non-integer elements.

    Division: Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their division. Catch the ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions.
